# Web Worker Demo

This [Web
Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) demo
shows how workers can be used to keep the main thread unblocked so that the UI
remains responsive.

The demo is available [here](https://www.dannyguo.com/web-worker-demo), and I
wrote a [blog
post](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-improve-interface-responsiveness-with-web-workers/)
for the LogRocket blog that discusses it.
